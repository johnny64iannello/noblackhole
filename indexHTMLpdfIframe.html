    <h1>BLACK HOLES DO NOT EXIST FOR THE ANTI-GRAVITY EFFECT OF THE FIFTH FORCE? UNIFIED THEORY BETWEEN THE FIFTH FORCE AND THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE IN GENERAL RELATIVITY</h1>
    <p><h3>ABSTRACT: 
      If we consider the “Fifth force” as an external force of the classical newtonian gravitational field introduced in the Theory of General Relativity, we will find the modified time metric tensor and so obtain the new modified Einstein’s  field equations.
      We unify the "Fifth Force" with the "Gravitational Force" applying the Theory of General Relativity. The result is that probably the "new modified Einstein's field equations" will not present any kind of singularity, with the presence of the anti-gravity effect of the "Fifth Force" in the nucleus of every astrophysical object; no existence of black holes? Peculiar phenomenology on stars and galaxies nucleus, the expansion or not of the universe can be fairly treated with the new modified Einstein's field equations.
      It is well known that General Theory of Relativity is a geometric theory of gravitation and the curvature of space-time is related to the energy and momentum. This relation is specified by Einstein’s equations. The experimental tests are numerous and, therefore, it is impossible to question its validity but this does not prevent us from proposing new ideas.       In this work, we want to introduce the Fifth Force, not considering the universal gravitational constant. In this way we obtain modified field equations. The aim of the paper is to observe that, if we introduce this fifth force, the principle of the equivalence is violated and, probably, there are never singularities in the metric when we solve the field equations.

       <p><h4>FLIGHTS’ INTERNATIONAL SECURITY RULE:
        “Safety-International Law about flights” for Political Science Universities. With too many airplanes' accidents, and with future dangerous flights, put all countries airports only on their beaches (and not inside the lands or islands); and the trajectories of flying objects, as airplanes, (projected floatable on seas as boats, to be less dangerous), must be only  over seas, and not over lands (to NOT CRASH on our heads).
        This for Everybody’s Life: to be less harmful to civil people and “less dangerous, more economic, less statistical, more realistic and less faster” for our so expensive-life. 
        Venice-Italy saying : “The apple can fall from the tree on our heads, the water melon, so heavy, cannot, because it grows on the earth: so no danger for everyone.”
        "Birds that fly aren't dangerous falling on human people: the birds are little and are not heavy, big and are not made of hard metal, as airplanes, that usually crash on our heads, destroying our lives".
